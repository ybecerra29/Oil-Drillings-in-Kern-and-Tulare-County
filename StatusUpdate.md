# Project Title: 
Environmental Justice in Kern County: The Effects of Oil Drilling Operations on Communities
# Group Members:
Nick Stewart-Boch, Melody Ng, Dinah Dominguez, Yesenia Becerra
# Roles: 
Yesenia (occupation, health outcomes, income): I’ll be working on pulling income, and occupation from the census tract data and seeing how that correlated with  

Dinah (): working on income data and census tract data

Melody (Ag, Oil Well, and Health Data Wrangler): I’ll be working on pulling usable health from CalEnviroScreen to create maps; helping Nick parse and map oil well data; and identifying, explore, and attempt mapping any usable agricultural data for Kern County (e.g. crop land boundaries)

Nick (oil, water, land use) I have been mapping oil data in interactive maps by well status. I have been trying to merge oil well data with social explorer census data but it is hard to tell if it is working given computer issues. I did merge oil data with CalEnviroScreen but the dataset became too big for Jupyter. Ideally, if there is a way of making it work, it would be great to provide spatial statistics of oil wells with health outcomes and environmental issues like poor quality.

# Status Update: 
Yesenia: I am personally having trouble working through data errors while coding, and seeing how data is not directly demonstrating or translating into the maps that I was hoping to showcase for our project. Since most of us in the group are having similar issues, we’ve spent some time troubleshooting and are still working through those issues on our own. I think we’d benefit from having a standing call for check in and troubleshooting together. 

Dinah: I am personally having trouble working on coding on my own. Office hours are helpful but I get discouraged when I can’t troubleshoot issues on my own. Meeting weekly with the team to get updates and check in is helpful. 

Melody: I think we’re all feeling a bit disconnected, and it’s personally been difficult to see how some of the pieces we’re working on now as individuals will fit together. Would like some group efforts to improve communication, so we know what our expectations are, where we’re all at, and maybe create space to share concerns about coding so that those concerns can be addressed and we can move more effectively as a team together toward the finish line.

Nick: I think I am getting the hang of coding a bit more for subsetting but am similarly feeling like our parts are a bit disconnected and am getting pretty frustrated with being unable to move to the mapping process because of computer issues, so am feeling somewhat stuck currently. 

# Data Update:
Oil data has been subsetted to include just idle, active, and new wells. This still is around 70,000 values so there is a lot of point data there. CalEnviroScreen seems to have all the health/environmental data we need for this project.

Our group is looking at the effects of oil drilling operations like refineries and oil drilling on the health of communities and sensitive receptors located near to these operations. We identified some areas of particular interests like occupational health hazards of workers like farm workers and racial, socio-economic trends that highlight environmental injustice in communities in Kern County.

# Concerns:
**Major:** Familiarity with CalEnviroScreen and Census data that can help generate helpful maps that address our major research questions. Troubleshooting coding errors with data that is available. 

**Minor:** Honing in on our research questions based on the data that we have worked through in our jupyter notebooks. 

We have identified these main research questions as areas of focus. Should we choose only a couple to focus on? And what would you all suggest we use to determine what to focus on and what to drop.
How do occupation distributions in the county relate to health outcomes? 
How does income/poverty rates in the county relate to health outcomes?
How do income/poverty rates in the county relate to occupation distributions?
How do the locations of oil wells impact health outcomes?
How do the occupation distributions relate to the location of oil wells?
How does zoning in the county impact health outcomes?
